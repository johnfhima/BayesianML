Code for the review of the paper : Deep learning: a bayesian perspective.

With this review, we provide 3 differents jupyter notebooks:

-The first one is Bayesian Deep Learning.ipynb wich implements a bayesian neural network trained on the MNIST dataset and provide two differents way of evaluating uncertainty thanks to this model. You just have to run all the cell. Everything is describe in the notebook.

-The second one is Bayesian-Droupout.ipynb which implements the model uncertainty in deep learning using Dropout. You just have to run all the cell. Everything is describe in the notebook.

-The third one is concentration of measure.ipynb which illustrate what our paper says about the concentration of the measure. You just have to run all the cell. Everything is describe in the notebook.
